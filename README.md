# Financial Aid at Columbia University

## Setup

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. Follow these steps to run the notebooks:
1. `pipenv shell` to enter a virtual environment.
2. `pipenv install` to install all necessary dependencies.
3. `jupyter notebook` to start the notebook server.

The `scorecard` notebook uses data from the College Scorecard. That data is too large to include in this repository, and it has to be downloaded separately. Instructions for doing so are in `/data`.
