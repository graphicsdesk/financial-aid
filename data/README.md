The College Scorecard data is too large to put in the repository. To obtain the College Scorecard data, download all the data [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/), unzip it, and put it into the `/data/scorecard` directory. The data version I used was last updated October 30, 2018.

`ConsumerPriceIndexData.csv` contains monthly consumer price indices (CPI) from 2008 to 2018. I copied this data from the [US Inflation Calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/) on January 1, 2019 ðŸŽ‰.
